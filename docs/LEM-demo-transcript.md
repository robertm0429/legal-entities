# Digital Gateway Legal Entity Management (LEM) - Demo Transcript

## Introduction

Welcome to this overview video of the Digital Gateway Legal Entity Management application within KPMG Digital Gateway. The purpose of the Legal Entity Management application, often abbreviated as **LEM**, is to provide a central place for all entity information that can be used across the Digital Gateway Core App Suite, as well as the underlying tax applications that integrate with Digital Gateway.

All entity information that is to be used throughout the other Digital Gateway Core apps must be entered in LEM to enable full integration and consistency in the entity data provided.

## Getting Started

After logging into Digital Gateway, navigate to the Legal Entity Management tile to preview the entity information. From here, you can:
- View the org chart
- Launch the Digital Gateway Legal Entity Management application

Once within the application, a list of all the entities set up under the client will appear on the entity list screen. To view additional information about an entity or to make changes to previously uploaded or entered information, click on the entity name. A set of screens will appear where you can add or edit information as needed.

## Entity Views

### Entity List View
You can also view the entities in a more visual format by clicking on the Org Chart screen, which is the same chart available on the Legal Entity Management page in Digital Gateway. This will draw an organizational chart based on the data provided. Users can easily toggle between the entity list view and the org chart view based on their preference.

### Organization Chart Navigation

At the top left of the screen, you will see several icons that will help you use the org chart:

- **Plus and minus icons**: Zoom in and out of the org chart for ease of viewing
- **Fit to Screen icon**: Redraws the org chart to show all entities in one view
- **Find icon**: Enter an entity name (e.g., "Demo Inc") and the org chart will outline the entity in red

#### View Options
To the left of the navigation icons, you can change the view of the org chart by clicking on the **Hamburger menu**:
- Select a predefined view to have a narrowed focus on a particular set of entities
- When selecting "Partnerships", it'll redraw the org chart to show all partnership entities within the structure
- Use the entity's toggle within the view's menu to select a particular entity to view

### Chart Settings (Top Right Corner)

#### As of Date
Selecting this button allows users to view the organization chart as of a certain date. All entity changes are assigned an as of date. Changing the date on the org chart will allow you to view what the chart looks like before and after a change took effect.

#### Chart Options
Here, you can enable various options to enhance your org chart:
- **Show intercompany loans**: Green arrows appear showing where there are intercompany loans between entities
- **Show multiple parents**: White arrows appear showing multiple parents, along with ownership percentages
- **Show entity attributes**: Attributes defined for the client and entity appear directly on the org chart

You can also **export the org chart** in PDF, PNG, or SVG file format.

#### Legend Icon
The legend box is a key to the entity shapes and lines that appear on the org chart.

### Creating Custom Views

To create a view, you have two options:
1. Apply filters to the org chart and save this view by giving it a name
2. Create a view in the client settings by selecting specific entities

Once saved, you can navigate to the org chart to toggle to that view.

### Entity Details Panel

To view additional details about an entity, click on an entity name from the org chart. The right-hand pane will appear showing available information about the entity:
- General information
- Ownership
- Assets and liabilities
- Documents
- Attributes
- Appointments

6. Select entities to include in this scenario
7. Click **Create Workspace** to finalize

### Working with Scenarios
